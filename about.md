My name is Aleksandar Serafimoski, I was born and raised in Macedonia. 
I came to the states in 2007 to attend my senior year of high school as a foreign exchange student.
Once I graduated from high school, I attended Loras College studying computer science. 
Upon graduation,  I got a job with a global software consultancy called ThoughtWorks. Over the last 10 years, 
I have visited 32 countries on three different continents. 

Throughout my ThoughtWorks career, I was lucky to have the chance to live in Pune, India and Chengdu, China. Currently I am based out of Chicago, and you can find me in the city(only on weekends).
